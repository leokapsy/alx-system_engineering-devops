# 0x0F. Load balancer

DevOps SysAdmin
Concepts covered:
	Load balancer
	Web stack debugging

Background Context:
-I'll be given two additional servers
	gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
	gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX

I'll improve my web stack so that there is redundancy for my web servers. This will allow me to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make my infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, I will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, I will need to write Bash scripts to automate my work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.
